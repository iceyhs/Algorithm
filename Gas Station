There are N gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at station i is gas[i].

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from station i to its next station (i+1). You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once, otherwise return -1.


public class Solution {
    public int canCompleteCircuit(int[] gas, int[] cost) {
         int diff=0;
         int total=0;
         int sum=0;
         int i=0;
         int j=0;
         while( j<gas.length){
             diff= gas[j]-cost[j];
             if(sum+diff<0){
                i=j+1;
                sum=0;
